### Q & A

#### Why there is a separate `int` type? Why `undefined` is missing?

For JS, it is correct that primitive types include `undefined` but at the same time doesn't differentiate integer from float point number.

However, I assume a preprocessing step before sending the value from client to the checker. Why we need to do that? First, WebIDL differentiate integer from float point number, so we can only get precise information to do this by asking from client side. Also, if anything is `undefined`, it shouldn't be sent to checker at all -- it must be *erroneous* (evidence?)
